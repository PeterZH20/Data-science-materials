# Data science + science materials

### This is a short compilation of the work I am doing for my thesis.
### The work consists of creating a database of materials for solar cells. The data is extracted from [The Materials Project](https://next-gen.materialsproject.org/), processed, stored and finally filtered for further use with machine learning.
